<hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;">
I'm currently a second-year postgraduate student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering (CSE), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Cyber Science and Technology (CST), [Shandong University (SDU)](https://cst.qd.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2024.

 I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoyuan Xie](https://xiaoyuanxie.github.io/) from the School of Computer Science, WHU. My research interests include, but are not limited to, software security and large language models, especially using AI to tackle some software issues (e.g., patch localization, bug-inducing commit identification).
